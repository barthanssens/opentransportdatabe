# Open Transport Data Belgium website

An initiative to publish automatically discoverable mobility datasets. OpenTransportData.be is supposed to become the main entrypoint for route planners in Belgium.

## Datasets to be added to our knowledge graph

 1. NMBS/SNCB
 2. De Lijn
 3. MIVB/STIB
 4. TEC
 5. Open Street Map Belgium as Linked Data

## Tutorials and demos

Our philosophy is to fragment every dataset in a certain way that makes it scalable for servers to host the data, and allows clients to work with the data. Therefore, it is slightly more challenging to start working with our datasets, but you should know that your investment in understanding how it works will make your application scale to many more datasets out there.

More coming soon.
